# Cover Letter

I'm a web app and game developer with 7+ years of experience. I've been making Javascript apps for 5 years and I follow game design best practices as a passion. I've been working with React and React Native for several years and I'm very comfortable with their ecosystem. I've long believed that React could be applied to game development more, and would love to get involved with this project.

#### How long have you been working with react-native?

I've been working with React Native about 2 years, and I've been working with React for 3 years. With RN, I made a user tracking app that displayed the route a user took using their Geolocation information. It was a great learning process, but React Native was still early in development when I started, so I had to solve a lot of problems for myself. I still enjoy RN development, and I'm excited to see the community growing.

Last year I went to Chain React, the React Native conference in Portland. There I met more of the community and learned about some of the trends that are taking over the industry.

I mostly work with Android less

#### Do you have experience publishing a react-native application to the Android Play store or the Apple App store?

I have experience going through the approval process for the Google Play store, but I havent worked with an App that has been widely installed from the store. The app I created required several permissions, include Geolocation, and I was able to successfully upload it along with the App store thumbnails and icons required.
